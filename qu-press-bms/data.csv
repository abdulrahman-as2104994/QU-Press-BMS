The Eloquence of Quranic Miracles and the Limits of Interpretation,Alaa Abdelmonem Ibrahim Amer,"Is the narration able to perform aesthetically in the absence of the “narrator”? Can writings, which claim to emerge from history and its facts, independently produce their anxious and insurmountable indication of proof without the “narrator’s” authority? Can analytical approaches that seek to explore the meaning of the text not imply against the attempts of neglect, marginalization or transcendence of the “narrator”? Is there a possibility to understand the function of the narrative requirements and their textual checks, without realizing the relationships and interactions that they establish with the “narrator? Such questions might be provoked in a discussion between readers and old narrative texts. Complete and incomplete answers are provoked with it as well, making it difficult not to have a “negation” as the main result. “Negation” results from the awareness accumulated by the narrative theory; that awareness of the narrative material is an indirect one. It is provided by a technical mediator between the recipient and the narrative world. The latter is not presented in a neutral way, but rather through a perspective that controls the nature of the relationships between its components.", literature ,,978-9927-139-04-8,978-9927-139-20-8,
The Arab media and public opinion industry during the Arab Spring revolutions,Abdel Salam Razzak,"""There are many skeptical readings about the causes and consequences of the Arab Spring revolutions, and many are drawn from conspiracies, which do not necessarily contribute to understanding the Arab Spring. The events that some Arab countries have witnessed since 2011 and still find their manifestations in Sudan, Tunisia and other countries, confirm that Arabs are living in a moment of historical articulation and unprecedented societal dynamism. Representing the emergence of a new political generation that embraces new ideas and confides on political media and social media tools, this generation manages to break the wall of fear and spread the seeds of revolution and change. The interaction between politics and media in the Arab world has resulted in a customary provocation of Arab political mentality. The latter has resided in tyranny and submission since the beginning of the last century. It is certain that the manifestations and mechanisms of conflict between revolution and counter-revolution must lead to change, even if no one has the foresight of its nature and function.""", Politics ,,978-9927-139-03-1,978-9927-139-21-5,

DNA paternity testing and disclosure of its incidental results: New Fiqhi Perspectives,Ayman Saleh,"This book is a model of Fiqh (jurisprudence) writing, in which the Faqih (jurist) utilizes the principles, “usul” of Fiqh, to produce “new Fiqh” that goes beyond the prevailing contemporary Fiqh, on the case of the effect of DNA test on paternity, which was often based on the Fiqhi extraction (takhrij) of old branches of Fiqh. These traditional perspectives were abandoned as the author judged them to belong to a historical phase where jurists aligned their Fiqh with the knowledge capabilities of their time.
The author was able to re-examine the issue, thus reestablishing it on its ""usuli” principles as well as exploring untrodden routes.

Qatar on the Arabian Gulf,Mohamed Hareb Farzat,"This book discusses the history of Qatar and reveals the cultural value of its geographical history and civilizational relations. It also outlines Qatar’s relation with its neighboring regions, such as Mesopotamia and the Levant, while highlighting the correlation between these civilizations. The book also provides an insight about the natural and wild life in the State of Qatar, as well as the archaeological excavations that happened in the country during various historical eras, starting from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age. It also gives insightful information about Qatar’s ancient history, due to its geographical location as a link between civilizations of the ancient Gulf and as a maritime hub of copper and silk trade between the Gulf countries and India.
The research approach applied in the book required the investigation of names given to many – or all – regions in Qatar throughout history, based on historical and linguistic evidences. The purpose is to create a new understanding of Qatar’s history, from its special location at the heart of the Arabian Gulf to its cultural, civilizational, historical and Arab Islamic surroundings. Many criteria have been taken into consideration: Qatar’s authentic mother tongue (Arabic), high values, and idiosyncratic identity in this contemporary world. 
Furthermore, this book provides a review about the Arabian Peninsula within the history of the Ancient East. This requires thinking of and recreating a comprehensive vision through the publication of significant scientific studies and the outcomes of archaeological excavations in the Arabian Peninsula. This is in addition to a detailed presentation of Qatar’s important strategic location, due to its recent renaissance and natural resources, such as oil and gas, making this country the blend of a civilizational legacy and a thriving present.

The Eloquence of Quranic Miracles and the Limits of Interpretation,Jamila Beckouche,"This book deals with the topic of ""Quranic miracles"", in an attempt to reveal the difference between scholars about ""the concept and location of miracles"". And if some fair studies have recognized the existence of miracles, and its manifestation in many ways, supporting the views of traditionists, and taking into consideration the sacred and inexhaustible interpretative aspect of the Holy Qur’an, and an attempt to explore the technical aspects and aesthetic characteristics that highlight the uniqueness of its miraculous structural system. On the contrary, other studies have called for a re-reading of the Qur’anic text, based on two aspects: the first aspect is criticizing the interpretative heritage of understanding the Holy Qur’an, and breaking the link with it, because it became unable to cover the textual purposes. While the second aspect relates to the use of scientific methods and contemporary procedural tools in reading the Qur’anic text, therefore it called for cognitive mechanisms based on interpretation and deconstruction, replacing the traditional mechanisms.

Contemporary studies did not stop at the doctrinal, cosmic, grammatical and rhetorical aspects covered by the traditional studies, but rather adopted a renewed methodology for reading the Qur’anic text, in a step to create a cognitive break with tradition, and keeping abreast of the current times. These contemporary interpreters have attempted to crystallize a new concept of Quranic miracle according to the dialectics of language and culture prevalent during and after the era of the revelation, and its relationship to other texts in this culture, based on ""variation"", or ""linguistic excellence"" in terms of a stylistic manifestation. Therefore, in contemporary Islamic studies, people talk about the ""limits of interpretation"" and call for its openness.", Religon ,,978-9927-139-13-0,978-9927-139-27-7,
Qatar and The Gulf Crisis,Kristian Coates Ulrichsen,"In 2017, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar, launching an economic blockade by land, air and sea. The self-proclaimed ‹Anti-Terror Quartet› offered maximalist demands: thirteen ‹conditions› recalling Austria-Hungary›s 1914 ultimatum to Serbia. They may even have intended military action. Well into its third year, the standoff in the Gulf has no realistic end in sight. With the Bahraini and Emirati criminalisation of expressing support for Qatar, and the Saudi labelling of detainees as ‹traitors› for their alleged Qatari links, bitterness has been stoked between deeply interconnected peoples. The adviser to the Saudi crown prince advocating a moat to physically separate Qatar from the Arabian Peninsula illustrates the ongoing intensity?and irrationality?of the crisis. Most reporting and analysis of these developments has focused on questions of regional geopolitics, and framed the standoff in terms of its impact on (largely) Western interests. Lost in this thicket of commentary is consideration of how the Qatari leadership and population have responded to the blockade. As the 2022 FIFA World Cup draws closer, the ongoing gulf crisis becomes increasingly important to understand. Ulrichsen offers an authoritative study of this international standoff, from both sides.", Politics ,,978-9927-107-740,978-9927-107-757,

It traces the start and development of human presence in Qatar since the very early prehistoric times, thousands of years ago until late Islamic era. In order to provide a broad spectrum of understanding of the factors influencing Qatar›s occupational potential, the author emphasized the roles of hydrology, climate and sea level fluctuations, and the likely pathways that people may have used to enter Qatar and the obstacles they had to overcome on their way northwards out of Africa during Paleolithic Age. The book is a vast comprehensive interdisciplinary research based on several years of intensive fieldwork and advanced information-gathering that produced significant new data related to several fields such as: environment, geology, geomorphology, climatology, hydrology, history and archaeology. The collected data and records have been analyzed, studied and presented within the context of the most recent discoveries from Gulf region. The main findings of this study are of great value to current urban planners, especially with the rapid population growth and development across Qatar. They are also significant for those involved in historical geography and population settlement patterns as well as field archaeologists.

Shura and its Impact on Democracy,Abdulhameed AlAnsari,"An early commentary on this revised edition: Some books enlighten, open and free the mind, thus effectively contributing to building the society. A book I read is titled “Shura and its Impact on Democracy”. It is such an insightful comparative study. The author, Dr. Abdul Hameed Ismail Al-Ansari, [Emeritus Professor & former Dean of College of Sharia and Islamic Studies at Qatar University] tells us about the importance and necessity of democracy, summed up in the fact that it is the only way for nations to progress and rise. The Holy Qur’an, the author explains, has stipulated the principle of shura as an obligatory and enforceable rule; however, the Qur’an merely stipulated the general principle and left its details to be adapted according to the nation’s varying and changing circumstances. This defines the possibility for the Islamic nation to benefit from other nations and their experiences if they are valid, and do not violate the general principles established in Islam. Humanity has known different administrative and government systems throughout history, and it has concluded that the best form of government is democracy, which essentially means rule of the people. Democracy has become the basis of modern systems that countries adopt for their advancement and progress. In the face of this growing importance and urgency of democracy, many questions arose about Islam’s position on democracy, especially about the relationship between shura and democracy, which this book discusses in detail. So, the thesis of the book explores areas of agreement between shura and democracy, and the difference between them, and focuses on how shura contributes to treating the criticism of democracy. It also highlights the possibility of benefiting from modern democratic methods; all with the aim of laying down general foundations that can be used to establish an Islamic political system which combines tradition and modernity. The content is unique: it endeavors to mix the original with the contemporary, something often overlooked when we talk about Islam in past tense.

" Representations of Women in the Poetry of Shiekh Ali Bin Saud Bin Thani Bin
Jassim Al Thani 1932-1999",Prof. Maryam A. Rahman R. Al-Naemi,"The poetic path of Ali Bin Saud was like any artistic phenomenon that emerged, blossomed, and then bore fruit. It was a process like that of gradation, in view of the various political, social, economic, and cultural factors that affected the cultural scene and the literary movement in Qatar. Looking into his poetry, one can say that he is neither a purely imitative poet, nor a reformer whose poems are abundant with romantic characteristics. Rather, he falls in between, and lays closer to the latter. If we take a closer look at the compositions of Ali Bin Saud’s poems, we find - inevitably - a pure romantic tendency, where we realize the extent of his openness to intellectual, philosophical and social currents. He believes that true art is not limited by borders, nor bound by restrictions; it is instead an expression of man and life. Ali Bin Saud draws words, expressions, visions and wisdom from the ancient Arab heritage, which should be a remaining part in Arabs’ lives and the world today. Simultaneously, he deepens the experience, emanating it from females as indicative of noble values of humans, believing that the depths of normal humanity are all full of goodness. Ali Bin Saud used femininity as a poetic icon, and a self-contained textual focal point in his poetry, which is fragmented into cultural, mystical, and human icons that turned through humanitarian and cultural courses into values of love, motherland, and humans.",,,978-9927-107-87-0,978-9927-107-88-7,

Summary of the General Provisions of Obligations in Qatari Law,Gaber Mahgoub Ali; Tarek Goma Elsayed Rashed,"The general theory of obligations is the backbone of all studies in legal science, where its rules govern most legal applications, especially in civil law. The theory has two parts; the sources of obligation, and the provisions of obligation; which represent this book’s subject, providing an explanation of the general provisions of obligations in the Qatari Civil Law. The book contains four chapters; the first chapter deals with the effects of obligations, as it begins with the study of the obligatory (in-kind and against a compensation) implementations of the obligation. The chapter ends with the study of the guarantees of the obligation’s implementation; these are the indirect lawsuit, the lawsuit for non-enforcement of actions, and the right to imprisonment. The second chapter studies the obligations’ descriptions.

Summary of the Sources of Obligation in Qatari Law,Gaber Mahgoub Ali,"The Qatari legislator organized the sources of obligation in (Articles 64-240 of the Civil Code). The sources of obligation are legal facts that result in the emergence of the obligation. They range from legal actions, to material facts.
The legal act is the direction of the will to produce a specific legal effect. The will may not have this effect unless it is linked to another will, and this is the contract and it is the most common and important source in creating an obligation. The contract raises many problems regarding its pillars and conditions, determining its effects and parties, and how it is annulled.
As for the unilateral will, it does not serve as a source of commitment except in the special cases determined by law, and its most prominent application is the promise of an award directed to the public.
As for material facts, they are either harmful acts that give rise to civil liability (for the personal act or for the act of others or for doing things) and result in an obligation to compensate the damage. Alternatively, they are beneficial actions represented in enrichment at the expense of others without reason and its applications are the delivery of the undeserved and leftovers.
Finally, the law comes as an exceptional source in the special cases in which the legislator directly addresses the creation of the obligation.",,,9789927139741,9789927139758,

If the insurance is in kind, the creditor has a right in kind to a certain debtor's money, under which he has priority over other ordinary creditors, and the creditors with the following in-kind insurance may require its right to the value of that money (immovable or movable) or any other money to replace it.

Introduction to Qatari Constitutional Law,,"Constitution is the supreme legislation in all countries of the world. It is above laws and regulations. This legislative document comprises the most important rules that regulate the regime, outlines the competencies of its public authorities, and emphasizes freedom, equality, and the sovereignty of the people and the law.

This book provides us with an opportunity to learn about Qatari constitutional law, as it focuses primarily on its sources and formal characteristics. It also studies the political system of the state, and the rules governing the inheritance of power in it, the mechanism of popular participation in power.

It is also meant to serve those who are looking to make a sensible judgment over the legal risks and benefits from entering into a PPP contract in Qatar. In addition, this study discusses the notion of whether PPP are truly novel contracts to Qatar legal system by cross checking a classic PPP contract against the specific agreements in Qatar’s Civil Code. We also examined the notion of whether a typical PPP contract would constitute a ‘public interests’ agreements (or ‘executive/administrative agreements’) or a non-public interest’s agreement (or ‘civil agreements’). We believe that this study has provided a more accurate analytical interpretation of what PPP is than the other attempts on this topic. ",,,9789927139642,9789927139659,

In order to comprehend the relation between the historical and the narrative (imaginary), and include it within a critical problem concerning the question of the working modalities of this historical narrative text, as well as the nature of its imaginary forms, history remains a narrative component capable of diagnosis and interrogation outside those assumptions on which the possibilities of writing and reading are based on.

The first field is aerodynamics. It is the study of how air flows around an aircraft, so that engineers can determine the proper fuselage shape. The body, tail, and wings affect the movement of air around flying objects.
Propulsion systems is the second field, which is the study of how to design the engines of flying objects that provide the thrust needed to take off and fly in the air. This study helps engineers determine a right type of engine and the right amount of power needed by flying objects. 
The third field is materials and structures, which focuses on the study of materials that should be used in the manufacture of flying objects and their engines. The choice of materials used to make the wings, tail and engine affects the strength and stability of an aircraft. 
Stability and control is the fourth field, which deals with the study of how to control speed, direction, altitude, and other conditions that affect the flying of an aircraft.

"The Basics of International Law 
(Qatar Version)","Math Noortmann
 Faisal M. Al-Hababi ","International law regulates the rules governing the relations between states among themselves or those to which international organizations are a party. A state must satisfy statehood criteria and other requirements in order for it to be considered as a subject of international law. In addition to states, intergovernmental organizations emerged as another subject of international law, which allows them, inter-alia, to conclude treaties and exchange diplomatic missions with states. International legal rules are mainly derived from sources such as customary law and treaties, in addition to other secondary sources such as principles of justice and equity, general principles of law, court rulings, international jurisprudence, and others. International custom is the traditional source of international law. It is represented in the progression of international behavior in a specific pattern accompanied by a sense of its obligation, that is, as a basis for a right or an obligation guaranteed by law. On the other hand, treaties are governed by the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which regulates treaty provisions from its making, through the principles guiding reservations and interpretation, to terminating or suspending them. Both treaties and norms regulate topics that concern the international community such as humanitarian law, human rights, diplomatic immunities, treaty law, state responsibility and settlement of disputes.

It also outlines Qatar’s relation with its neighboring regions, such as Mesopotamia and the Levant, while highlighting the correlation between these civilizations. The book also provides an insight about the natural and wild life in the State of Qatar, as well as the archaeological excavations that happened in the country during various historical eras, starting from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age. It also gives insightful information about Qatar’s ancient history, due to its geographical location as a link between civilizations of the ancient Gulf and as a maritime hub of copper and silk trade between the Gulf countries and India.
The research approach applied in the book required the investigation of names given to many – or all – regions in Qatar throughout history, based on historical and linguistic evidences. The purpose is to create a new understanding of Qatar’s history, from its special location at the heart of the Arabian Gulf to its cultural, civilizational, historical and Arab Islamic surroundings. Many criteria have been taken into consideration: Qatar’s authentic mother tongue (Arabic), high values, and idiosyncratic identity in this contemporary world. 
Furthermore, this book provides a review about the Arabian Peninsula within the history of the Ancient East. This requires thinking of and recreating a comprehensive vision through the publication of significant scientific studies and the outcomes of archaeological excavations in the Arabian Peninsula.

Introduction to Qatari law,Mohammad Ammar MHD Borha Ghazal,"This book is the students' gateway to the science of law in all its categories, but it does not thoroughly go into details of any of them, because it is an informative introduction related to all law categories without any specification. However, the focus on civil law as the general legal code for many laws, necessitated a reference to some important details in Qatari Civil Code, especially with regard to basic topics, such as: the rules for applying the law in terms of place and time, the rules of the legal personality of a natural person and a legal person, and the theory of arbitrariness in using the right...etc.
As the Constitution of the State of Qatar focuses on the role of Islamic Sharia in all aspects of social life, considering it the main source of legislation, the first article of the Qatari Civil Code came to oblige the judge to rule according to Islamic Sharia in the absence of a legislative text. In addition, the Qatar Civil Code takes into account many general rules in Islamic jurisprudence, as well as several detailed provisions such as the provisions of gifts, missing or absent person, eligibility...etc. Therefore, the provisions of Islamic Sharia were clearly taken into consideration in writing of this book, so that students are aware of this matter and realize the importance of Islamic jurisprudence as one of the major legal systems in the world.

The Principle of Abuse of Rights in International Law: The Gulf Crisis as an Example – An Empirical Study,A group of researchers,"The principle of “abuse of rights” is an early international law principle. Despite its significance in international law, taking into consideration the practice and the violations that may fall under it, the complexity of evidence required to rely on this principle reveals that international jurisdiction lacks the principle of abuse of rights in endorsing international responsibility. However, the principle of abuse of rights is fundamental in international law literature and is endorsed by many international conventions and provisions that emphasize the need to adhere to it, taking into account the consecutive events that are happening in the region. The international law literature also covers the adaptation to countries behaviors and the rights and duties of nations in compliance with international law. Therefore, to which extent the actions committed in creating the Gulf crisis and its aftermath, claiming the use of rights, became an abuse of rights? 
 
This book identifies the principle of abuse of rights, as a factor of international responsibility, and discusses the scope of rights as well as the duties that fall under international law. It also highlights the actions committed by nations – whether they are positive, taking the form of an act, or negative, refraining from doing an act – to prove if the international actions undertook in the context of the Gulf crisis fall under the abuse of rights.

Open a GLAM Lab (English),A group of researchers,"Defining a GLAM Lab: 
 A Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM) Lab is a place for experimenting with digital collections and data. It is where researchers, artists, entrepreneurs, educators and the interested public can collaborate with an engaged group of partners to create new collections, tools, and services that will help transform the future ways in which knowledge and culture are disseminated. The exchanges and experimentation in a Lab are open, iterative and shared widely. This book describes why and how to open a GLAM Lab and encourages participation in a movement that can transform organisations and the communities they partner with.
 Building a GLAM Lab: 
 Building a GLAM Lab involves defining its core values to guide future work, fostering a culture that is open, transparent, generous, collaborative, creative, inclusive, bold, ethical, accessible and encourages a mindset of exploration. The Lab should be grounded in user-centred and participatory design processes and its staff should be able to clearly communicate what the Lab is about. It's important to think big but start small and establish quick wins to get up and running.
 GLAM Lab teams: 
 There are recommendations for the qualities and skills to look for in Labs teams, how to go about finding allies within and outside the institution, and ideas on how to create a nurturing environment for teams to thrive in. Labs teams have no optimal size or composition, and its team members can come from all walks of life. Teams need a healthy culture to ensure a well-functioning Lab which might be augmented intermittently by fellows, interns or researchers-inresidence. For a Lab to have lasting impact it must be integrated into the parent organisation and have the support of staff at all levels.
 User communities: 
 GLAM Labs will need to engage and connect with potential users and partners. This means rethinking these relationships to help establish clear and targeted messages for specific communities. In turn, this enables Labs to adjust their tools, services and collections to establish deeper partnerships based on co-creation, and open and equal dialogue.
 Rethinking collections and Data: 
 The book discusses the digital collections which are an integral part of Labs. It provides insights on how to share the collections as data, and how to identify, assess, describe, access, and reuse the collections. In addition, there is information about messy and curated data, digitisation, metadata, rights and preservation.
 Transformation: 
 Experimentation is the critical core of the Lab's process. Insights about how to transform tools into operational services are demonstrated. It shows that experimentation can prepare the organisational culture and services for transformation. There is an examination of funding and the advantages and disadvantages of various models through discussion of the different mechanisms and options that an organisation can apply to Lab set-ups.
 Funding and Sustainability: 
 We share insights on how to plan for a Lab's sustainability as well as a step-by-step guide for when an organisation is retiring or decommissioning a Lab.
 Labs have a pivotal role in the transformation of GLAMs and the book highlights the critical importance of Labs in changing the future of digital cultural heritage.",,,978-9927-139-11-6,,

"Prohibition does not Encroach to a Second Party:
A Theoretical and Practical Study on Financial Transactions",Hossain Mohamed Naimul Hoque,"The book aims to study the juristic precept of (the prohibition does not encroach to second party) in terms of its tenor, cases, conditions, and dilemmas. The writer discussed this precept within its theoretical and practical dimensions, in perspective of trustworthy sharia sources, by comparing with famous juristic schools and scholars opinions. The book relies on several scientific methods; such as inductive method, analytical method and comparative method, and came to the conclusion that the jurists, including the jurists of four famous juristic schools, abide by this precept in some cases but do not comply with it in some other cases, depending on the conditions and circumstances of each case, and they divide the illicit wealth into two types – self–illicit wealth and incorporeal–illicit wealth; the first one cannot be legal thorough changing the custody of the wealth, while the second one may be legal in some cases with special conditions. The book sheds light on all those significant issues in pampered details.",,,978-9927-139-42-0 ,978-9927-139-42-0 ,
